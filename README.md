# Text-Processor
A Python Tkinter desktop app combining three text tools in one: a word-frequency analyzer with file browsing, a palindrome checker that ignores punctuation and case, and a Caesar cipher for encrypting/decrypting text. Simple, beginner-friendly, and easy to run.
A Python + Tkinter Desktop Application

This project is a simple, beginner-friendly desktop app built using Python and Tkinter.
It combines three commonly used text-processing utilities into one clean interface:

🔹 Word Frequency Analyzer

Select any text file using the built-in file browser.
The app reads the file, cleans the text, and displays a sorted list of word frequencies.

🔹 Palindrome Checker

Enter any sentence or phrase and check if it’s a palindrome—ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case.

🔹 Caesar Cipher Tool

Encrypt or decrypt text using a customizable shift value.
Letters are safely rotated while punctuation and spaces are preserved.
